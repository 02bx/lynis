Lynis is an security auditing and hardening tool for Unix derivatives like Linux, BSD and Solaris. It performs
an in-depth scan on the system to detect software and security issues. Besides information related to security,
it will also scan for general system information, installed packages, and possible configuration mistakes. The
software is aimed at assisting automated auditing, configuration management, software patch management,
vulnerability detection, and malware scanning of Unix-based systems.
